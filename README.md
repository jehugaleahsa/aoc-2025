# Advent of Code 2025

For years, I've heard developers talking about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). I'd hunt down the website and see this impossibly cryptic ASCII art. It looked cool, but I had no idea what it was all about. This is going to sound stupid, but... I didn't know when it took place. 😐 At one point, I was thinking, "Oh man, this must be one of those crazy complicated hacker things where you have to decrypt something on the page to get past the entry point." So, you can imagine, me scouring through the HTML trying to find something, only to eventually give up.

Uh, yeah, that's not how Advent of Code works at all. It's "advent", as in "advent calendar". Durp. 🤦‍♂️

So, finally in 2025, someone reached out to me on the 1st of December to let me know it's starting. It's just another Hackerrank, or Project Euler, or LeetCode challenge, turns out.

## Rust Rust Rust Rust

For the past 3-5 years, I have given up more and more time to learn Rust. I'm to the point where I read an article summary every weekend: [This week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/). This past, year, though, I put the books down and actually started trying to code something useful. And then, a few months ago, I started on my [Handmade Hero in Rust](https://github.com/jehugaleahsa/handmade-hero-rs) adventure. Basically, the more I work in Rust, the more I come to love it. Rather than it only being awesome on paper, it's when you start working with the stdlib that you really come to appreciate how amazing the language, the library, the ecosystem, really is. In prior coding challenges, I tried out languages like Haskell or Scala. Going forward... Rust might be the only programming language I ever have interest in ever again. Bold statement, I know.

## The challenge with challenges...

It's Day 08 when I am writing this. `[I hate missing READMEs.]` Amazingly, I've managed to collect all 16 stars so far. I'm going through a bit of a life change right now, which is the only reason I can dedicate 2+ hours day to work on this. My friends, who are also working on the challenges, have been, you know, living their lives and slowly falling behind.

I just keep thinking... I'm more than halfway done... almost done. C'mon, stick to it!

Some days have been awesome - no complaints. Other days have required spending most of my time just parsing the file. I am glad none of the challenges, so far, have required me to "just know that one math trick" or waste hours finding a more optimal solution. Needless to say, I don't think I would want to do this year after year.

I also feel, regardless of who makes these challenges, eventually the novelty wears off. I've been programming for 20 years, and I have honed my ability to translate ideas into code. I think if you're fairly new to programming and working on your fundamentals, this stuff is still really helpful for growing as a developer. I am not sure knowing memoization off the top of your head is particularly helpful - you either know it or you don't - but giving up and seeing "that one simple trick" is a learning lesson in itself, I guess.

## Conclusion

So, basically, this is yet another great way to play in Rust without starting yet another massive side project. 😄 I won't be sad when it's over! I've actually really enjoyed it so far. I think maybe a few "almost too hard" moments have just rattled my nerves - all the more satisfying when I earn the next star!
